# Ainnogallery, online art exhibition platform

Ainnogallery is an online art exhibition platform. Before Ainnogallery, I have never been co-working with programmers nor have experienced my design put into real service.

The most memorable task was keep asking fellow programmers about css properties to understand and fix what is causing my design to not workout in browsers. There were lots of shadows, photo frames and lights for exhibition design and it was hard to reproduce it on browser screen.

To reduce the gap between design and service, I started to take online courses on HTML, CSS. The reason I started studying web technologies was all based on me becoming better designer.

# Hommage to Korean Movies exhibition

To promote Ainnogallery our team opened an exhbition called **Hommage to Korean Movies** with a gallery in Chungmu Street, Seoul(famous for movie industry). Exhibition, as the name speaks, 14 artists re-visualized their favorite Korean movies in their own style.

During the course of exhibition, from morning to evening something went through my mind. "Whatever I do later in my life, I don't want to lose this exact feeing". I found my reason of living. I am happy when people experience something new because of my thought.
