# Read with your hand, Choseh

Choosing and quoting important things to write is called 'Choseh'. Choseh is simply a reading note.

I had my own rules of writing reading note since my sophomore year. Page numbers, quotations and opinions were written with symbols to differentiate from each other. Me and my friend thought these rules can be represented as markdown syntaxes.

# Reading note powered by Markdown

Every reading note contains quotation, opinion and page number. Choseh utilizes markdown to support users to format their notes. Choseh also had features called bookshelf, which is a collection of books. Users also could subscribe to other user's bookshelf.

Choseh is really special to me. I will keep reading books and writing notes. Choseh as a service ended in 2016, however part of it continues inside [my blog's library](https://indegser.com/book). You can check what kind of books I read and thoughts I have.
